        Reference protocol to control a surface by server.
        To control a surface by server, it gives seat to the server
        to e.g. control Home screen. Home screen has several workspaces
        to group launchers of wayland application. These workspaces
        are drawn on a horizontally long surface to be controlled
        by motion of input device. E.g. A motion from right to left
        happens, the viewport of surface is controlled in the ivi-shell
        by using ivi-layout. client can recognizes the end of controlling
        by event "workspace_end_control".
